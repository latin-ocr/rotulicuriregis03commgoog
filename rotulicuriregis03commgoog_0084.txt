is generally designated either as “Dominus
Archiepiscopus'' or “Dominus Cant’.''
From the similarity between the letters t ,
and cin the record, the word “Cant’ '' has,

in the extracta heretofore made from these

Rolls, beentranscrihedas ‘⁶ Canc' ”3 so that,
supposing any legal hypothesis had been
grounded upon the printed text, the en-
quirer would have inevitahly transferred
the Justiciar’s authority to the Chan-
cellor.

The policy of the reign of Coeur de Lion

is of no import, except to the historiari or
the antiquary. But it maybe here remarked,
that an error, exactly ol the same descrip-
, tion, probably contributed to establish the
authority ol arrest and detention exercised
by the members of the Privy Council. ln a
case arising out of their supposed jurisdic-
tion‚ a document was produced, which, any
person moderatel y acquainted with recorda,
would, Ithink, have expounded as eviden-
ciugacommittal “per dnos de Concili0.”
The Court admitted the reading, ‘⁶ per duos
“ de Consilio ;’' and the ambiguous form of
a letter, vested in any two individuol mem·
bers, whose signatures could be obtained,
the power which, according to the antient
constitution, belonged to the Lords of the
Council sitting in their corporale capacity,

. and as a tribunal.
