Quinzaine of man. In an assiae conceming a virgate of

{illidi ὼε land in Pertinges in the county of Sussex,

¹³⁰h' it was found to he the lay see of Peter, the
son of Henry the Mayor of London, and
cf Ysabella the wife of the said Peter.
This last entry is curious, as giving some
particulars with respect to Fitz Ailwin's
family.

It may not be unimportant to add, that, Appx.t
in a grant made by Fitz Ailwin, one of
the persons vouched in the attesting clause
is Radulphus Brand, probably a kinsman of
Robert Brand. And, named in the same
character of witnesses are “ J ordanus filius
Sperling‚'' and “Jordanus filius Jordani,”
either of whom may he the same individual
as Jordan the Tanner. The seal os this
document is much defaoed, but enough re-
mains tc shew that Fita Ailwin was repre-
sented uithhawk nullst, in baronial guise.
And the seal comes in support of the old
tradition oi London, that the Aldennen
ranked as Barons. Such tokens of station

were not assumed without due warrant.

Some particulars concerning the topo-
graphy of London may be collected from
the Rolls. Newgate, under the name of
Neu-port, was already used as a gaol.
“Old Street without London'' then and

now still hears in its name the memorial ol
its Roman antiquity.
