“ J usticiar8,'’-it was decreed by John the
Kiug’s brother, and by all the Bishops,
EarlS, Barons, and by the Citizens of
London, that the Chief Justiciar should
be deposed from the govemment of the
Kingdom. Earl John was then proclaimed
“Summus Rector totius Regni.'' This
appointment'was in no ivise contemplated
hyKingRichard'spatentsorcommissions;
und John, in the exercise ol his authority,
appointed the Archbishop of Rouen as

Chief Justiciar under him, in conformity, ,

to the Justiciar. He fainted on receiving
the news, and dropped senseless on the
floor.

The part taken hy the Citizens of Lon-
don in this transaction is very remarkable.
