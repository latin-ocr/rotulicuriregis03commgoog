lxxvi INTRODUCTION.

Ralph de Dicetn, a most trusty and ac·
curate testimony, was not acquainted with
the history of the treasure, and commemo-
rates Peter Busil--and not Bertrnm de
Gurdun--as the soldier by whose arrow
Richard was strichen. And the chronicle of
Dunstaplc, the Annals ofMargan, Matthew
Paris (or rather Roger wendover), and
Walsingham, relating the story of the trea-
sure, all designate the same Peter Basil as
the' youth by whom the quarrell was dis-
charged.

The manuscript chronicle of Winchester
agrees with the last preceding authorities
in naming Peter Bastt as the man, but
differs from them by ascribing to this indi-

vidual the unhappy iate of Bertram de Gur·
dun, ’ and yet witha variation. Mareadeus
surrendered the prisoner to Richard's sister
Joan, Countess of St. Giles‚ and rire, anda,
not Marcadcus, plucked out his eyes, and

caused him to suffer other horrible mutila-¹
tions and turtures, under which he expired.

The anonymous continuator os Geoffry,
the Prior of VigeoiS, a Limoisin Monastery‚
places two knights, Peter Bru (perhaps ²
Brun) and Peter Basil, in the tower from
whence the missile proceeded: and addn,
that as it was reported, -a report which
he repeats without positively adopting it,-
PeterBasr'l was the marksman.
