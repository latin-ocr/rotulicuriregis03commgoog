memoriale relating to his transactions on '
the Rolls ol the Curia Regis, clearly declare
thah the writs issued by Longchamp the
Chancellor‚ emanated from the jurisdiction

of Longchamp the Chief J usticiar.
Το these secular powers, were added the

vast ecclesiastical authority which hc de-
rived from his legatine commission. He is
represented as tyrannizing equally over
clergy and laity, confounding right and
wrong, offending and oppressing the whole
community by his insolenee and rapacity.
“ Had he continued in office,''.- said his
enemies‚-“ the kingdom would have been
“ wholly exhausted, notagirdle would have
“ remained to the man, nor a bracelet to
“ the woman, nor a ring to the knight, nor
“ a gem to the jew.''-- Most violent dis-
sensions arose between the Chicf J usticiar
on the one part, and Earl John and the
Magnetes on the other part: and they ad·
dressed a letter to Richard, who was then
on his voyage to Palestine‚ declaring the
fearful mischiefs which the J usticiar was
occasioning to King and Kingdom. But,
before we adurit the truth of these accusa-

tione, we must pause. TheJusticiar steadily
opposed and counteracted the preten-
sions of John, who was endeavouring to
secure his succession to the throne; and

we may suspect theta portion, and pro- .
naconem. d
