nutes to reinstate the Legate in his former
station of Justiciar. Amongst other reasons,
they urged that it would much displease
the King, to know how Longehamp had
been thus displaced from the government
of the Kingdom without his command.
A strange assertion this, in the iace of the

letters patent by which John and his par-
tizanshadeffected Longehamp’s expulsion,
but entirely conformable to Longehamp's
declarations: and confirmed, indeed, by
what is stated, that Richard's determination
to return to England was accelerated by
the intelligence of Longehamp's removal.
Talen any way, such an argument is a
strong exemplification of the prevailing
wantos truth and principle.

Of John’s exertions on behalf of Long-
ehamp, one example is narrated with
amusing particularity. A Council or, as
we should call it, a Parliament, being as-
sembled at London, the messenger of
Longehamp, Legate and Chancellor, sud-
denly entered, announcing the arrival
of his master at Dover. Alarmed at such
intelligence, they forthwith send to Earl
John, who is at Wallingford. Another
Council is held. In this, John informs
them that Longehamp defies them all,
provided he can obtain his, John's, pro·
tection, for which he offers seven hun·
dred pounds, to be paid within a week.
