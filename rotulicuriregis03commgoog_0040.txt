months, the Pope suspended the sentence,
to the intent that the Monks might, if they
pleased, appear and shew cause against it.
Their poverty incapacitated thern from
making their defence, and, as it is said, a
sentence was pronounced, by which they
were expelled ; but it is by no means cer·

pressed‚ as pleaded by the Canens. The
hood and the amice replaced frock and
cowl. The Canons were installed: and,
the better to efface all recollection of the
former inmates‚ Bishop Hugh pulled down
the conventual buildings, and rebuilt them
upon a new plan, paying the expences with
the moveable goods of the late community.

lt appears, however, from the pleadings
on the roll, that the Monks kept together as
a body, notwithstanding their expulsion ;
nor was any legal objection taken by the
Court against their corporate existence.

times, the Monks of La Trappe and the
Nuns of Syon having, though despoiled of
their possessions, equally withstood the
Revolution os Franoe, and the Reformation
