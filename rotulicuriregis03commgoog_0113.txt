INTRODUCTION. xcix

“ cerely desire, that by all my endeavours
“ God may be glorified, the trutb, divine
“ or human, vindicated, and the publick
‘⁴ bonefited:

“ Sic mihi contingat vivere, sicque mori.'’

Such remarks are ,. too instructive to be
omitted. They are the memorials of a
period when the indiyiduals most distin·
guisbed by knowledge, by learning, or by
intellectuat eminence‚ were impressed with
the deep feeling of the duties resulting from
the important station whereunto they had

been called. Raised up as teachem, freely
dispensing the gists freely bestowed upon
them, seeking neither present fame nor

worldly profit, but acting under an humble
responsibility for the faithful use of the

talents entrnsted to their stewardship. And
indeed, these sentiments and principles
will alone enable tbc inquirer to proceed
steadily and cheerfully, in labours, which
even bumanly speaking, can never be
ripened into harvest, until the hand that
sowed the seed is mouldering in the grave.
Pursued with any other motives, the dreary
annals of literary history will warn him how
little chance he has of escaping from the
most bitter vexation, sorrow, or despair. ¹
