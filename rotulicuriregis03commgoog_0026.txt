xii INTRODUCTION.

Richard, when a discussion arose con-
ceming the aids granted to the King for
his ransom. RichardFitz Osbertexclaimed,
“ in recompensa sor the money taken from
‘¹ me by the Chaucellor within the Tower
‘⁶ of London, ,1 would lay out sorty marks
‘⁶ to purchase a chain in which the King
“ and his Chaucellor might be hanged.'’— (Noa c.)
There were others present who heard this
speech, Jordan the Tanner and Robert
Brand, without doubt the two true men
noticed, but not named, by Ralph de
Dicet0‚ whose brief account of the trans-
action agrees, so far as it extends, with
the record. And they also vied with Richard
Fitz Osbert in his disloyalty. “Would that
‘⁶ the King might always remain where he
“now is‚'’ quoth Jordan. ln this wish
Robert Brand cordially agreed—And,-
“ Come what will,'’- they all exclaimed,-
‘⁶ in London we never will have any other
‘⁶ King except our Mayor ;'’- Henry Fitz
Ailwin of London Stone. .

The Appellees‚ in due form, denied the
whole accusation “ de verbo in verbum,'’and
demanded the franchise of London, or the

· right possessed by the citizens of defending
’ themselves by compurgati0n‚ according to
the old Anglo·Sarron laws of their ancestors.

Upon this plen, a day was given to thern on
Sunday next after the feast os St. Kathe·'
