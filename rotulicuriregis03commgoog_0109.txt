people should have done fealtyto him, then
it was certain that all who, being under his
dominion, perpetrate any act against the
peace, should be as grievously punisbed as
under the dominion of his living father.
And the lesser Commoos were prevented
from perpetrating this iniquity, because im-

uttovum mediately upon King Henry’s death, “ on
the Morrow of Saint Edmund the Arch-

bishop,'’ the Earl of Gloucester, the Arch-
bishop of York‚ and many other Nobles of Ι
therealm os Englandthen present,ca1ne into
the City and caused peace to be proelaimed
towards all, both Jews and Christians.
From this proceeding‚ three important
saeta may be collected respecting the theory
aod practice of the Constitution in relation
to regal successim, as prevailing when
Henry III. closed his reign: l.—Thepeople
of London‚ more thoroughly an Anglo-
Saxon community than any other then sub-
sisdng, and probably never merged in any Ι .
