the King's command. ln this assembly nutura

Longchamp Bishop of Ely, the Chaucellov, (Edffion),

was formally appointed Cbief J usticiar of {ffumin-
England toniense.
Longchamp had gained the entire con-
fidence of the King‚ who stood by him to
the last. Richard wished to exalt him above
all competitore. ln addition to the two
great offices of Chief J usticiar and Chancel·
lor, Longchamp sought the highest eccle·
siastical authority· The Archbishopricks
were filled3 buthe despatched his agents
to Pope Clemeut‚ soliciting the Legation
of England. Richard supported the appli-
cation, and the willing Pontiff granted the
hoon‚extending the legatine province of the
Justiciar, not merely to this Kingdom, but
to Wales and Ireland, or so much at least
of that island as was subject to the English
Crown. And about the same time, Richard
being then at Bayonne, he issued letters
patent, addressed to all his lieges‚ com-
manding them to obcy the Bishop in all
Α things, even as he the King himself was
to be obeyed. ‚This instrument, though
dated some months subsequently to Loug-
champ's appoiutment‚ seems in fact to be
the patent of the J usticiarship.
Longchamp's character was one of sin-
gular activity, which displayed itself in
every branchos its administration. We

owe the Tower Ditch to the Chiel J usticiar ι
