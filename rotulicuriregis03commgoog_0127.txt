Pope vas startled and scared, and after expressing his surprise
to the Cardinals in somevhat miseemly language, be turned to
the Monk, and said, “ Brother, by St. Peter you shall not wait
lor my death, your petition is granted ;'' and before Pope Inno-
cent again tested food, he issued the Bull by which Archbishop
Hubert was authorized to restore the Monostery.

Now ss this statement is wholly inconsistent with the Bull,
vhicb ispreserved textually and entire, we must either admit
that the documentis s forgery - and, st this period, the practice
of fabricating spurious Bulls prevailed exceedingly—or that
Motthevv Paris, the Monk of St Albans, was singularly
deceived

Omnibus Sanctae Matris Ecclesioe filiis, praesentibus et futuris,
Hubertus Dei gratia, Eboracensis ecclesiae Deesnus, aeternsm in
Domino salutem. Sapientis est hiis, quae soluteanimae proficiunt,
dum potest, intendere et transitoriis aeterna commutare. Quod
quidem intelligentes ..... quoddam coenobium Praemonstratensis
Ordinis in feudo nostro, apud Derham fundavimus, pro salute
auimae meae, et patris et matris mete, et Domini Rounlplzi dc
Glonoilld et Bertae uxoris ejus qui nos nutrierunt (Monosticon,
vol. vi. 899.) -Geoffry Fitz Peter is one of the attesting wit-
nesses to the Charter.
